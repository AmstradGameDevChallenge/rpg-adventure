# RPG / Rogue like adventure game for the AMSTRAD CPC

![C Version v0.0.3 screenshot](img/c-v0.0.3.png)

This is part of the [AmstradGameDevChallenge](https://github.com/AmstradGameDevChallenge). The idea is to develop the same game in BASIC and C.

## The game

You're in a room, with a monster lurking nearby. You can move around, pick weapons, and figth the monster.

## Can I just try the game?

Yep, grab latest disc images here:

- ðŸ’¾ C     - [Download](basic/c/rpg/rpg.dsk) 
- ðŸ’¾ BASIC - [Download](basic/rpg.dsk) 


## TO-DO list

- [ ] feature parity C/BASIC. Will focus on C development and then try to emulate the same in BASIC.
- [ ] add back start screen to the C game
- [ ] add fight phase only when close to the monster
- [ ] weapon picking
- [ ] weapon selection
- [ ] add more rooms, and doors to connect rooms
- [ ] add some sound effects
- [ ] add some music. Don't know how and don't have any music. Help welcome!
 

## Dev environment used

- CPCTelera v1.5
- macOS Mojave 10.14.5
- Retro Virtual Machine 2

## Compiling

You need to install the prerequisites:

- [CPCTelera v1.5 installation instructions](http://lronaldo.github.io/cpctelera/files/readme-txt.html#Installing_CPCtelera)
- [Retro Virtual Machine 2](http://www.retrovirtualmachine.org/en/)
- unix2dos to convert UNIX CR/LF into AMSTRAD CR/LF. Install with Homebrew using `brew install unix2dos`

### BASIC game

No, BASIC is not compiled. But you still need to put the `.bas` file in a disc image and launch the emulator. To do this (and some more) you have the script `basic/make.sh

### C game

You need to have CPCTelera already set up in order to compile.

Once done. run `c/rpg/make.sh`
